this is GCSE NEA works from a few years back that i got assigned for computer science because the year 9 work was too easy

## the actual assigned criteria
- there was some really specific foods and prices but i didnt follow those
- allow for a main side and drink to be picked
- give the user a price once they pick and submit their order

## other stuff
- my teacher said i should do it in python because that is what i need for gcse
- i havent used python seriously for a while before this
- the other people that were assigned this (like 2 other people) just did this in the python shell or whatever
- i decided to make it a website and use websockets to add table bookings
- part of it was meant to be in python because my teacher said i need it for gcse 
- i made the backend in python and did the frontend in js + html
- more fun to code than i thought considering i havent done anything serious in python for a while
- i probably took it way too seriously, i think it was intended to be a relaxed project
- i was going to make it look better with css but i realised my design sucks so i just decided not to
- if you want to improve my code make a pr or something idk
- apparently when this was still in the gcse you could do it in any language but i thought yeah i need python somewhere so i can get used to it again
- im making too many points
- i am going to try to use conventional commits for this please do the same if you make a pr
